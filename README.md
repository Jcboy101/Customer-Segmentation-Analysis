# üõçÔ∏è Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM & KMeans Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering on an e-commerce transactional dataset. RFM is a powerful marketing technique for understanding customer value and tailoring strategies accordingly.
 It also handles outliers separately to improve clustering quality and business insight.

 ## üìä What is RFM?
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes a purchase
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money a customer spends

---

## üìÇ Project Overview

Many companies have thousands of customers, but not all of them behave the same. Some buy frequently, others once in a while. Some spend big, others very little. This project applies RFM analysis and clustering to identify these patterns and guide marketing decisions.

## üîç Objectives

- Calculate RFM metrics per customer
- Detect and isolate outliers
- Segment customers using KMeans clustering
- Visualize and interpret customer clusters
- Provide marketing recommendations per segment

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed rows with missing `Customer ID`
- Filtered out rows with negative `Quantity` or `Price`
- Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime

### 2. RFM Feature Engineering
Calculated for each customer:
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase (relative to the latest date in dataset)
- **Frequency**: Number of unique purchases (InvoiceNo)
- **Monetary**: Total amount spent (Quantity)

### 3. Outlier Detection and Handling
- Used **IQR method** to detect outliers in RFM features
- Outliers were **excluded from main clustering** to prevent skew
- They were later **assigned to a dedicated 'Outlier' cluster**

### 4. Clustering
- Scaled RFM features using `StandardScaler`
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to find optimal `k`

- Applied **KMeans clustering**

- Final results include 4 clusters + 1 for outliers

### 5. Distribution Analysis with Violin Plots
-To better understand the spread and distribution of RFM scores across clusters:

-Generated violin plots for each RFM metric per cluster

-These plots combine boxplots with kernel density estimation to:
 -i: Visualize skewness and outliers within clusters
 -ii: Compare variability across clusters for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary

This helped validate cluster compactness and identify inconsistent segments.



### 6. Visualization
- Scatter plots of clusters by RFM dimensions
- Cluster-wise comparison bar charts
- Silhouette score plot and Elbow curve
